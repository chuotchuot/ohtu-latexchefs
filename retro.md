# Latexchefs - Sprint 2 Retrospective

# General

The retrospective was held after end of Sprint 2.

Team used Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of -method for the meeting. A circle was drawn on whiteboard and divided to five sections specified in the name. The team openly suggests pointers for each sections and discusses them freely afterwards. At the end, team chose couple actions to focus on for next sprint.

## Start

- Creating more descriptive variable names.
- Checking for on-going builds before pushing changes. 
- Taking more varied tasks on sprints and avoid specializing on specific tasks.

## End

- Pushing any changes that have not been tested locally with automated tests.
- Deleting configuration files.

## Continue

- Ensuring that CI build is successful after pushing changes.
- Work has been distributed rather evenly, and everyone finishes their tasks on time.

## More of

- Examining affects that code changes have in other parts of the project
- Developing highly dependent tasks together to avoid bottlenecks.
- Communicate updates, blockers and ideas more often and freely.

## Less of

- Finishing crucial tasks late on the sprint.

## Actions to take

- Communicate more in teams communication channels
- Focus on running tests more often locally.
- Team is developing script for easier local testing of all test types.


# Latexchefs - Sprint 3 retrospective

# General

The retrospective was held after end of Sprint 3.

Team used Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of -method for the meeting. A circle was drawn on whiteboard and divided to five sections specified in the name. The team openly suggests pointers for each sections and discusses them freely afterwards. At the end, team chose couple actions to focus on for next sprint.

Team also took note of the previous actions and how we have implemented the changes.

- Communicate more in teams communication channels
  - The bar for communication was lowered for the sprint, with lots of discussion in Discord regarding planning, design and issues.
- Focus on running tests more often locally
  - Team developed small script that handles all of the tests (robot, unit, pylint, coverage). The amount of local testing improved in general, leading to less breaking in builds.

## Start

- Refactoring more on each iteration
- Utilizing classes to model behaviour
- Clear communication on dependent tasks

## Stop

- Leaving tasks towards end of the sprint

## Continue

- Comprehensive robot testing
- Good communication and support

## More of

- Utilizing dev branch during the sprint

## Less of

Team couldn't think of anything

## Actions

- Start refactoring code
- Communicate clearly if other unfinished tasks block you from working on task.
- Work in more steady pace
